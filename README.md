# Lottery dApp (Web)

This repository holds the **frontend code** for the Lottery dApp. Users can enter the lottery by paying an entrance fee, and the contract owner can pick a winner at the end of the lottery duration.

> **Note**: The **smart contract code** is maintained in a separate repository. Please see the [Lottery Contract Repository](https://github.com/sukrutnrvd/lottery-contract) for details on how the logic and prize distribution are implemented.

## Overview

- **Enter the Lottery**: Users connect a wallet and pay the required fee.

- **Display Results**: Shows current participants and the last winner.
